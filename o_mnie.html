           <h1> Hello there! I'm Tomasz Milewski, an 18-year-old computer graphic artist and photographer residing in Poland. Ever since I was little, I've dreamt of becoming a computer graphic designer, and now, it's a dream I'm actively pursuing as I shape my future. My hobbies include computer graphics, photography, and learning programming on the side.

When I delve into the realm of computer graphics, I feel right at home. It's not just a hobby for me; it's a way to express myself. Creating virtual worlds, experimenting with colors, and designing beautiful compositions bring me immense joy and fulfillment. As you can see from my artworks, wolves are my favorite motif, reflecting my deep fascination with these beautiful and majestic creatures. Each piece I create is a testament to my passion and dedication.

I also have an immense love for photography. My photographs are brimming with emotions, capturing the smallest of details. I enjoy creating images that tell stories and come alive before the viewers' eyes. Besides computer graphics and photography, I also dabble in programming as a hobby, constantly expanding my skill set and opening doors to greater possibilities.

When it comes to online work and creating designs for t-shirts, I approach it with a sense of responsibility and dedication. I pay attention to every detail to ensure that each design I create is flawless and meets the clients' expectations. My positive attitude, ability to work in a team, and professionalism make collaborating with me a true pleasure. I always strive to listen and understand the clients' needs, delivering designs that exceed their expectations.

Outside of work, I adore spending time with my four-legged companionâ€”dogs. I have a deep appreciation for their loyalty and love, which often translates into incorporating them as subjects in my artwork.</h1>
